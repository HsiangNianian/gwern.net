# title-cleaner.py: remove cruft from titles of web pages like website name/domain or error messages

#
# When scraping HTML web pages, using the <title> field naively gives bad results: many are covert error pages, or a fixed site-wide constant string, or uselessly vague/short, or prepend/postpend the site URL or the site name or a whole variety of bizarre things.
# Manually writing rules to clean them up turns out to be unmanageable due to the extreme long-tail of handling >20,000 URLs on gwern.net
# However, the badness in scraped titles is very much a "I know it when I see it" thing and can usually be done in isolation when looking just at the text.
# So that means it is feasible to call out to a LLM to clean up the title.

If the title can be fixed, remove the junk (spam, cruft, boilerplate) from the title.
If the title looks good, then print out the original title.
If you are unsure how to fix it, then simply print out the original title.
