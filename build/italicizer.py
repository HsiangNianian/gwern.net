# italicizer.py: reformat a string to add italics as semantically appropriate (eg. book titles) using LLMs

#
# Usage: $ OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-XXX" echo [...] | python italicizer.py
#
# Italicizer tries to remove a common annoyance in PDF & HTML-sourced titles: loss of italics formatting.
# Input a string, and it will return a new string with italics added, or an empty string literal `""` (to explicitly denote no change & save tokens).
# Italics are intelligently added where high-quality formal English writing would use them, eg film or periodical titles, unusual foreign words, species names, etc. (See the prompt for full details.)
#
# Because of the complexity of adding italics, this is a standalone script. For general-purpose title reformatting, see </static/build/title-cleaner.py>.
#
# If you parse HTML pages for `<title>`, or use APIs like the Wikipedia API, or extract titles from XML PDF metadata, they usually omit italics or make them hard to get, where the correctly-formatted title is presented at all.
# (For example, the standard WP API will not provide the 'formatted' title; one has to use a different endpoint.)
# This is quite annoying if you link a lot of material about books, movies, or foreign topics, as I do, because the metadata will silently be mis-formatted according to standard English conventions. (You don't "read Moby-Dick", you "read <em>Moby Dick</em>".)
# This cannot be easily solved by more complicated scraping, because there is a long tail of metadata sources and in some cases there may be *no* metadata anywhere in the target which includes italics (the target may simply have not bothered to italicize anywhere!).
# But it is something which is easy for a knowledgeable human to do, because they know 'Moby-Dick is the name of a famous novel, and novel titles should be italicized'; it is just too tedious to do at scale.
# This makes it a perfect use-case for LLMs.
#
# Example:
#
# $ OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-XYZ" echo "Moby-Dick" | python italicizer.py
# <em>Moby-Dick</em>
# $ OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-XYZ" italicizer.py "the musician Moby-Dick"

    model="o3-mini", # the 4o/o1-mini models aren't smart enough but o1 is too expensive ðŸ˜¢; we compromise with 'o1-preview' which benefits from <https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-caching> to cut its price when we run a lot of title-cleaning. Why is that when this seems like such an easy task, albeit a little fiddly? The smaller models seem to fail catastrophically on paper titles, no matter how many I put in, so my best guess is that this is 'tail dropping' behavior from the very aggressive shrinking of small models, to eliminate as much factual/memorized knowledge as possible. (ie. they've forgotten all these papers, which the original large models knew from pretraining on said papers, or at least metadata of those papers or on other papers referencing them)

f"""Task: reformatting text to add missing italics.

Summary: Add (HTML <em></em>) italics to text with un-italicized words or phrases.
Follow standard English formal writing style in italicizing.
Words which should be italicized include:

- titles: book, movie, long poem, TV show, periodical, game
- names: ship, plane, spaceship
- words: unfamiliar foreign word or phrase
- science: variables, scientific names like species names
- musical terms

Words which should not be italicized:

- personal names or location names (whether or not foreign)
- software/database
- short works: short stories, poems, symphonies
- loanwords (or other common foreign terms a reader would not need defined)
- brands
- punctuation which is not part of the italicized phrase
- abbreviated titles or acronyms

If the text is correct or you are unsure what to italicize, return the empty string.
(It is better to leave text unchanged than italicize incorrectly.)
If punctuation follows an italicized phrase, keep punctuation outside the <em> tags.

Do not add quote marks, or make any other corrections.
Do not add extra explanation or disclaimers.
When in doubt, consult MOS:ITALIC <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Text_formatting#Italic_type>.
